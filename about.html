            <h3> About Carlo</h3>
            <p> Hi! I'm Carlo Velarde and I am a Computer Science student at the University of Iowa. My goal is to work as a Software Engineer where I can build and fix things!</p>

            <p> Throughout my time in university, I have made an effort to gain hands on experience in a varierty of different fields. My first big experience was Summer 2024 when I participated in New Mexico Tech's NSF REU where I conducted research on code obfuscation performed by LLMs. Since then, I have interned as a Software Engineer at Western Digital where I learned about test automation and the intersection of hardware and software. More recently, I interned at Mastercard where I learned how software moves money.</p>

            <p> When I am not working, there is a high chance I'm off doing something basketball related. Every since I was a child, I have been a huge basketball fan. I've played growing up and even now I love to play pickup. If I'm not playing basketball, I'm watching it, whether that is college or NBA. If you ever want to talk or debate hoops, let me know!</p>
