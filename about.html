            <h3> About Carlo</h3>
            <p> My name is Carlo Velarde and I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Iowa pursuing a degree in Computer Science Bachelor of Science. My goal is to work as a Software Engineer after I receive my degree.</p>

            <p> I chose to study Computer Science because I have been in love with computers since elementary school. It began with videogames but it quickly developed into other areas. One of my early interests was graphic design. I would create profile pictures for different social media apps, profile banners, and even advertisements for games and busineses. I still do this on my freetime. Another interest was building computers. The summer of 2018 I built my first computer. This was a huge milestone for me. Building my own computer taught me a lot about how computers work and what sets other computers apart. </p>

            <p>Towards the end of highschool, I realized I have always used software but never created it. Creating my own piece of software became my new goal. I believed studying Computer Science would be the best option to help me achieve that goal. I am now two years into university and love it more everyday. I am excited to work on more projects, especially projects that have impact.</p>
